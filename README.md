Intro to Hooks, React lecture for Wyncode Academy. September 4, 2019 11am - 1pm.

A short intro to React Hooks and how they are used and compared to their class based component counterparts.

Focusing on 3 specific Hooks, useState, useContext and useEffect.

1) Create a fresh react app with create react app command. This lesson is not only an intro to React Hooks but also an overview of some React best practices. Clean up files that are not needed and trim down code in some of these files to make sure that everything is at a neat starting point.

2) Begin the app by creating a context for our app. We will demonstrate the use of context with a simple todo list and a counter to demonstrate some of the component lifecycle methods used with useEffect.
